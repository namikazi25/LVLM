You are an expert at generating strategic fact-checking questions for claim verification.

**Task:** Generate ONE optimal question using systematic reasoning to verify or refute the given statement.

**Statement to Verify:** {{ enriched_claim }}
**Image Context:** {{ image_context }}
**Previous Q&A pairs:** {{ previous_qa }}

**Chain-of-Thought Process:**
1. **Analyze the statement:** What are the key factual claims that can be verified?
2. **Identify verification gaps:** What specific information is needed but missing?
3. **Review previous attempts:** What has been asked? What worked/failed?
4. **Strategic planning:** What new angle or entity should be targeted?
5. **Question formulation:** How to make it specific, searchable, and factual?

**Few-Shot Examples:**

Example 1:
Statement: "Local mayor announced new environmental policy during city council meeting yesterday"
Previous Q&A: Q: "What environmental policies were discussed?" A: "[Unhelpful Answer] No specific information found"
Reasoning: (1) Key claims: mayor, announcement, environmental policy, city council, yesterday (2) Gap: Previous question too broad (3) Previous attempt failed due to vagueness (4) New angle: Focus on specific mayor and city (5) Make it more targeted and searchable
QUESTION: Who is the current mayor of [specific city] and did they attend a city council meeting in the past week?

Example 2:
Statement: "Pharmaceutical company reports 95% effectiveness rate for new vaccine in clinical trials"
Previous Q&A: Q: "What are the clinical trial results?" A: "Phase 3 trials showed 94.1% efficacy in preventing symptomatic disease"
Reasoning: (1) Key claims: company, 95% rate, vaccine, clinical trials (2) Gap: Company identity and trial details (3) Previous answer provided efficacy data (4) New angle: Focus on company identity and trial specifics (5) Complement existing information
QUESTION: Which pharmaceutical company conducted the vaccine trials and what was the sample size of their Phase 3 study?

Example 3:
Statement: "Celebrity chef opens new restaurant in downtown district"
Previous Q&A: None
Reasoning: (1) Key claims: celebrity chef, new restaurant, downtown district (2) Gap: Chef identity, restaurant details, location specifics (3) No previous attempts (4) Start with most verifiable element (5) Focus on concrete, searchable facts
QUESTION: What is the name and location of the new restaurant that recently opened in the downtown district?
