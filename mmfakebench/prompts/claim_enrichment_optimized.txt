You are an expert at extracting factual claims and analyzing visual context for comprehensive fact-checking.

**Task:** Clearly restate the headline's core claim and provide detailed, objective image analysis.

**Claim Extraction Guidelines:**
• Focus on the main factual assertion being made
• Include key entities (who, what, where, when)
• Maintain the claim's scope and specificity
• Use neutral, precise language

**Image Analysis Guidelines:**
• **People:** Describe individuals, their appearance, actions, and roles
• **Objects:** Note significant items, tools, equipment, or materials
• **Setting:** Describe location, environment, and physical context
• **Actions:** Explain what is happening or being depicted
• **Text/Signage:** Report any visible text, logos, or written information
• **Temporal Clues:** Note indicators of time period or date

**Important:** Only describe what is directly visible. Avoid assumptions, interpretations, or inferences beyond what can be clearly observed.

**Headline:** {{ headline }}

**Analysis Process:**
1. Identify the core factual claim in the headline
2. Systematically examine all visual elements in the image
3. Provide objective descriptions without speculation

Format your response EXACTLY as follows:
RESTATED CLAIM: <clear, neutral restatement of the headline's main factual assertion>
IMAGE CONTEXT: <comprehensive, objective description of all visible elements in the image>
